# SVM
Support Vector Machines in Python

In this project we will build a Support Vector Machine for classification (shown below) using scikit-learn and the Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel. Our training data set contains continuous and categorical data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to predict whether or not a patient has heart disease.
